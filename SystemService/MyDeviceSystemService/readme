Add the MyDeviceSystemService

1. init.rc
  : If you want to add your service than use the "class late_start".
    Because if your service started before the AOSP system service is not running yet.
    than your service is running but there're no service in the "service list" of AOSP.
    You can check the AOSP service lists by using the "adb shell service list".
  [init.rc]
  service mydev-service /system/bin/mydev-service
      class late_start
      user root
      group root
